# ASU_BDS_MS
---
This is a collection of code I wrote for some of my course assignments during my Biological Data Science Master's program at ASU. Not all code is here, I am still working on pulling it all together across my desktop, laptsops, etc...

This does not include the topics covered in my capston (LSC585/586)

## Topics Covered
- Python scripting
- Databasing (SQL/MySQL)
- Statistical methods
- Data visualization in R
- Python/R notebooks

## Courses
- ACO501: Database Systems and Problem Solving in Python
- ACO580: Intro to Python for Problem Solving
- LSC540: Statistics for Biological Data Science I
- LSC541: Statistics for Biological Data Science II

- Still gathering code, I want to show my notebooks from my differential equations / linear algebra Python course
